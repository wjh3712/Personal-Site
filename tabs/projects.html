            <td>
                I collaborated with one of my peers to design and construct a fundamental RFID tag and reader system, which underscored my proficiency in circuit building and practical engineering. 
                By assembling RFID components and sensors, we developed a functional system that allowed seamless communication between the RFID tag and reader. This hands-on experience enabled me to gain a deep
                understanding of circuitry, sensor integration, and security systems. Importantly, this project was undertaken outside of my academic coursework.

            <td>
                Engaging in a self-directed project, I utilized public domain software, my personal computer, an RTL-SDR dongle, an antennas to explore local radio stations. By integrating open-source tools, I converted my
                computer into a functional radio receiver, allowing me to delve into a range of frequencies and radio transmissions. This project provided hands-on experience with signal processing, spectrum analysis,
                and radio technology, highlighting my proactive approach to independent learning and practical problem-solving.

            <td>
                I embarked on a project focused on aircraft tracking in my local area, employing radio technology as the key component. By leveraging readily available public domain software, my personal computer, RTL-SDR dongle, and antennas,
                as well as using Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) technology, I was able to capture and analyze radio signals, leading to the successful gathering of accurate locational data for individual aircraft.

            <td>
                This was my class project for an electrical electrical engineering systems design class. The robot's objecive had been to assist with rescue operations 
                in fire accidents or wildfires. The robot needed to auto-navigate through terrains as such and detect hot objects. The robot's parts comprised sonar sensors, a thermopile, motor control driver, multiplexer, Arduino Nano, and more. This project
                taught me top-down design and bottom-up implementation, as well as the need to "fail early and fail often" in the engineering process.
