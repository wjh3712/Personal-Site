                Andy Wang is a 20 year-old student and thinker at the University of Michigan — Ann Arbor.
                He is studying towards a B.S.E in Electrical Engineering and is primarily interested in electromagnetics, radio frequency
                circuits, and wireless technologies, broadly speaking. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Andy grew up in New Zealand. He credits his easy-going attitude and sense of adventure to the Kiwi culture he had experienced in
                the Oceanian country. Andy moved around somewhat a lot from Hamilton to Christchurch to Auckland — various cities in NZ — so
                adjusting to new places isn't an issue for him. The Kiwi bloke attended high school at King’s College, Auckland, a private boarding
                school where he lived in dorms for 5 years, the boarding aspect of which he has fond memories. During his senior year of high school, Andy was dual-enrolled at
                the University of Auckland under the Young Scholars Program through which he studied university-level statistics. After finishing high school,
                Andy moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan in the United States for college. While he misses parts of NZ, he likes the change of pace in the US.
            </p>
            <p>
                In his spare time, Andy likes to read, write, exercize, socialize and, most of all, enjoy his turbulent yet colorful phase as a college student.
